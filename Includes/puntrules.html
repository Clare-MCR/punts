    <h4>Punting Rules and Regulation</h4>
    <p>When booking a punt you are agreeing to the rules listed <a href="http://mcr.clare.cam.ac.uk/punts-booker/punt-rules" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h4>Mobile Number</h4>
    <p>To book a punt your mobile number is required for both subsequent users to contact you in the event of the punt not being returned to the quay on time, and for the Admiral of the Punts to contact you in the event of discrepancies in the state of the punt or accessories. Please note it will be displayed on the Booking List for that day's booking on the front page.</p>
    <h4>Time</h4>
    <p>The 23:00 slot holds until 07:00 the following morning by default for nighttime punting. Please note DURATION is not required for an overnight booking.</p>
    <p>Please note, bookings starting at 21:00 and 22:00 will be maximum lengths of 2hrs and 1hr respectively to not block the 23:00 slot.</p>
    <h4>Good Behaviour on the Punts</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Remember you will only be able to obtain a set of punting keys after leaving your Cambridge ID card with the porters.  DO NOT take keys directly from returning punters (who need to exchange them for their ID card at the porters lodge).</li>
        <li>Make sure locks are always locked <b>ABOVE WATER-LEVEL</b></li>
        <li>Keep the keys in a safe place and <b>DO NOT</b> drop them in the river!  You are expected to pay for replacements if this happens.</li>
        <li>Rubbish:  Please be considerate to other MCR members and take all of your trash with you after your journey.</li>
       	<li>Accidents/Problems: Report any accidents, lost equipment, or other problems immediately to the punts officer at <a href="mailto:mcr-admiral@clare.cam.ac.uk">mcr-admiral@clare.cam.ac.uk</a>.  For urgent problems you can call my mobile: 07761452919.</li>
